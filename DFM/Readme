In this folder you can find the example to get the out-of-sample data for the DFM. Unzip the files of "data_Monthly_Homicides"
in the same folder you will run the "DFM_MonthHom_guns_1factor_pseudo6_tri.R" file. You will get the same files which are already store in the zip file "Results_MonthHom_guns_1factor_7series". The file "Summary results_DFM_tri_outofsample" read the
results for each case and compare them with the real values in the "error" tab, to get the accuracy per month in the "acc" tab. You will have to change the route in the "Summary" fules to read from the results files, and get the accuracy per month. Due to the convergence of parameters, forecast can be marginally different while estimating.
